    <h3>Versailles is one of the largest, most elaborate, royal palaces ever built. This huge and magnificent palace started as a hunting lodge that was built for King Louis XIII in 1624. The small lodge was the beginning of an extremely huge palace that would cost the French government more then they could imagine.
        Louis XIV (The Sun King) built Versailles to be his home. To Louis, a magnificent palace was a must for royal life. All of the kings and nobles had to have wonderfully decorated palaces (houses), with beautiful paintings, ballrooms, and expensive furniture.</h3>
        <h3>The Palace of Versailles is a former royal residence commissioned by King Louis XIV located in Versailles, about 19 kilometers west of Paris, France.</h3>
