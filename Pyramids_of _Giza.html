    <h3>The pyramid stands at 451 feet high and was the tallest structure on Earth for thousands of years. In fact, it was the tallest human-made structure until 1300 C.E. The base of the pyramid is 755 feet long on each side. If you dropped the pyramid in New York City, it would take up a whole city block.</h3>
    <h3>The last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the great pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the most famous and discussed structures in history. These massive monuments were unsurpassed in height for thousands of years after their construction and continue to amaze and enthrall us with their overwhelming mass and seemingly impossible perfection. Their exacting orientation and mind-boggling construction has elicited many theories about their origins, including unsupported suggestions that they had extra-terrestrial impetus. However, by examining the several hundred years prior to their emergence on the Giza plateau, it becomes clear that these incredible structures were the result of many experiments, some more successful than others, and represent an apogee in line with the development of the royal mortuary complex.</h3>
